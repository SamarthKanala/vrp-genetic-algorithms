# Optimization for Vehicle Routing Problem using Genetic Algorithms ðŸššðŸ§¬

## Overview
This project applies **Genetic Algorithms (GA)** to solve the **Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP)** â€” a classic logistics and supply chain optimization challenge. Using Pythonâ€™s **DEAP** evolutionary computation framework, the project also demonstrates GAâ€™s flexibility by solving a **maze routing problem** before extending it to VRP.

## Features
- Developed GA-based optimization for VRP with **DEAP**.
- Designed a **custom fitness evaluation function** to minimize distance and cost.
- Experimented with mutation, crossover, and selection strategies.
- Implemented a **maze solver** to test GA approaches before applying to VRP.
- Visualized routing results with **Matplotlib**.

## Tech Stack
- **Python 3.10+**
- **DEAP** (Distributed Evolutionary Algorithms in Python)
- **Matplotlib** (visualizations)
- **NumPy** (numerical operations)
- *(Optional)* Pandas, Seaborn

## Results
- Optimized vehicle routing paths, reducing total travel distance.
- Demonstrated adaptability of GA in multiple problem contexts.
- Produced clear visualizations of optimal routes for decision-making.
